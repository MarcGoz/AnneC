    <p>Track suits and red wine
Movies for two
We'll take off our phones
And we'll turn off our shoes
We'll play Nintendo
Though I always lose
'Cause you'll watch the TV
While I'm watching you
There's not many people
I'd honestly say
I don't mind losing to
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Dumb conversations
We lose track of time
Have I told you lately
I'm grateful you're mine
We'll watch The Notebook
For the 17th time
I'll say "It's stupid"
Then you'll catch me crying
We're not making out
On a boat in the rain
Or in a house I've painted blue
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
So shut all the windows
And lock all the doors
We're not looking for no one
Don't need nothing more
You'll bite my lip and
I'll want you more
Until we end up in a heap on the floor
Mmm
You could be dancing on tabletops
Wearing high-heels
Drinking until the world
Spins like a wheel
But tonight your apartment
Had so much appeal
Who needs stars?
We've got a roof
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Mmm
No, there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Track suits and red wine

We'll take off our phones
And we'll turn off our shoes

On a boat in the rain
Or in a house I've painted blue
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
So shut all the windows
And lock all the doors
We're not looking for no one
Don't need nothing more
You'll bite my lip and
I'll want you more
Until we end up in a heap on the floor
Mmm
You could be dancing on tabletops
Wearing high-heels
Drinking until the world
Spins like a wheel
But tonight your apartment
Had so much appeal
Who needs stars?
We've got a roof
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Mmm
No, there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Track suits and red wine
Movies for two
We'll take off our phones
And we'll turn off our shoes
We'll play Nintendo
Though I always lose
'Cause you'll watch the TV
While I'm watching you
There's not many people
I'd honestly say
I don't mind losing to
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Dumb conversations
We lose track of time
Have I told you lately
I'm grateful you're mine
We'll watch The Notebook
For the 17th time
I'll say "It's stupid"
Then you'll catch me crying
We're not making out
On a boat in the rain
Or in a house I've painted blue
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
So shut all the windows
And lock all the doors
We're not looking for no one
Don't need nothing more
You'll bite my lip and

We've got a roof
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Mmm
No, there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Track suits and red wine
Movies for two
We'll take off our phones
And we'll turn off our shoes
We'll play Nintendo
Though I always lose
'Cause you'll watch the TV
While I'm watching you
There's not many people
I'd honestly say
I don't mind losing to
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Dumb conversations
We lose track of time
Have I told you lately
I'm grateful you're mine
We'll watch The Notebook
For the 17th time
I'll say "It's stupid"
Then you'll catch me crying
We're not making out
On a boat in the rain
Or in a house I've painted blue
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
So shut all the windows
And lock all the doors
We're not looking for no one
Don't need nothing more
You'll bite my lip and
I'll want you more
Until we end up in a heap on the floor
Mmm
You could be dancing on tabletops
Wearing high-heels
Drinking until the world
Spins like a wheel
But tonight your apartment
Had so much appeal
Who needs stars?

Dumb conversations
We lose track of time
Have I told you lately
I'm grateful you're mine
We'll watch The Notebook
For the 17th time
I'll say "It's stupid"
Then you'll catch me crying
We're not making out
On a boat in the rain
Or in a house I've painted blue
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
So shut all the windows
And lock all the doors
We're not looking for no one
Don't need nothing more
You'll bite my lip and
I'll want you more
Until we end up in a heap on the floor
Mmm
You could be dancing on tabletops
Wearing high-heels
Drinking until the world
Spins like a wheel
But tonight your apartment
Had so much appeal
Who needs stars?
We've got a roof
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Mmm
No, there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Track suits and red wine
Movies for two
We'll take off our phones
And we'll turn off our shoes
We'll play Nintendo
Though I always lose
'Cause you'll watch the TV
While I'm watching you
There's not many people
I'd honestly say
I don't mind losing to
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Dumb conversations
We lose track of time
Have I told you lately
I'm grateful you're mine
